### Class Access Specifiers
## Public
    Public data members are accessible to anyone, inside or outside of the class.
## Protected
    Protected data members are accessible only to derived/subclasses of a class.
## Private
    Private data members are only accessible within a class.


### Inheritance
    Inheritance


### Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is a design rule that groups similar data together either within classes or as a general rule.

### Polymorphism
    When the same entity behaves differently in different scenarios. For example, C++ allows for operators to be overloaded to act differently for different classes and objects.

## Runtime Polymorphism
    In runtime polymorphism, the function call is resolved at runtime, and the compiler deduces the object at runtime then decides which function call to bind to it.
