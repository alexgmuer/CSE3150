// Write in a class in order to read in from the personal_notes.md file,
// partition the sections into a class hierarchy, overload the >> operator
// so that the class object can be easily printed as a tree structure, 
// make it so that the definitions/section bodies can be extracted from the 
// class object using methods.

// Utilize virtual methods somehow
